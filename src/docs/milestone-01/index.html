        <h2>Application Parts</h2>
        <p>The existing plans page is necessary to understand the function of the application. A plan is a group of trails, flights, and hotels that the user puts together to create a trip. 
          The existing plans page stores all existing plans and allows users to edit or delete their plans. Next to each plan is the estimated length of each trip. This page offers an organized 
          space for all plans so that users can easily see what they have coming up or what plans they can put into action when they only have a certain amount of time on their hands.<br /><br />

          The recommendation page is one of our most important pages as it caters to newer users. It recommends trails based on the information the user provides. The user chooses their 
          experience level, their desired trail distance, and a general location and our app makes API calls to hiking trail APIs to get trails that fall within the user's specifications. 
          Users can then add this trail to an existing or new plan. This feature encourages users to hike as it eliminates the discouraging process of sifting through trails that may be out 
          of their comfort zone. <br /><br />

          The search page is another key component of our application. Users are greeted with different categories of what to search for such as trails, hotels, and flights. Once they click 
          on their preferred category, they can search within that category, and corresponding results show up with descriptive images and an option to add that result to a current or new plan. 
          The search page allows users who already have an idea of what they would like to do on their trip the freedom to search without messing with small details present on the 
          recommendation page. <br /><br />

          <h4>Angelika Integrative Experience</h4>
          <p>This project ties in both experiences from my classes and my internship. CS 325 gave me a lot of good design experience as our semester project was creating a website that was 
            accessible and intuitive. I learned how to make wireframes, how to use the 60-30-10 rule, how to keep human tendencies in mind, and more, all skills that are very applicable to the 
            web application we will be building. In my internship I worked mostly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I felt like my aptitude for these languages really improved over the summer 
            and I hope to put that to use in this project. I am currently taking Public Interest Technology and Ethical Considerations in Computing which have opened my eyes to the ways 
            technology has been used to harm marginalized communities and I hope my experience in those classes will influence my decision making in this project to emphasize ethical technology.
