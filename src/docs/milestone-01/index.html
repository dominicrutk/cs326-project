          I have taken CS 325 Human-Computer Interaction and I have research experience
          at the UMass HCI-VIS lab as I am interested in designing websites with human 
          tendencies in mind. I have also taken some upper level programming courses 
          such as AI and NLP. I have internship experience as a Software Development 
          intern at Wells Fargo where I designed branded email templates using HTML 
          and CSS and used Javascript to translate templates for our automation software. 
          I am interested in NLP and the intersection of Technology, Ethics, and Policy 
          and my current research is using NLP to guide more equitable legal decisions.</p>

          Having taken numerous computer science courses in data structures and algorithms, 
          I have a strong background in programming.  In particular, I feel that my 
          experience using TypeScript in CS220 will be an asset during this project.

          I have taken CS 121, which helps with the transition 
          to JavaScript. I was a Product Manager with BUILD UMass under a project with 
          Upward Bound, which helped me learn a lot about good and accessible website 
          design. My past internship experience has been in Technology Consulting and 
          Financial Analyst. The presentation and communication skills I learned will 
          be useful for this project. Outside of work, I like to participate in 
          Business Ethics Competitions and organize Hack(H)er413, a women and 
          non-binary empowering hackathon.</p>

          I have taken a variety of upper-level courses in computer science 
          including computer networks, search engines, computer 
          graphics, and randomized algorithms. I am also doing research in randomized 
          algorithms for numerical linear algebra with Professor Cameron Musco. 
          Outside of school, I have interned at several companies including Onshape 
          and Roblox, where I have developed my software engineering skills in languages 
          like TypeScript and C++ and frameworks/tools like AngularJS and Git. This coming 
          summer, I will be a software engineering intern at Databricks.</p>
